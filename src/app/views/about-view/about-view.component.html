        I'm a software developer based in Nuremberg, Germany, living in Tönisvorst. My interests include
        mathematics, illustration, music, and game design.

      <div class="text-base md:text-lg text-left font-semibold py-2 text-zinc-500 px-4 select-none">
        I studied mathematics in Siegen and Düsseldorf and have been working as a software developer since 2020.
        Blending these interests into personal projects is one of my favorite things — right after time with my
        people and dogs.
